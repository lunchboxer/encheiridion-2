# Encheiridion notes

I originally wrote a list of categories and specific interventions, but I found a lot of commonality between the different interventions and couldn't ever be specific enough to meet all situations anyways. Instead I have decided on a universal individual intervention guide. After that I'd like to develop an intervention guide which includes more than one person and one for the whole class or a larger group.

The web app allows focusing on one step at a time and has easy logical branching.

Next step is the multiple student intervention guide. That is more complicated and I think it should start from scratch with some non-violent communication and restorative practice foundation texts.
