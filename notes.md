# Encheiridion notes

I originally wrote a list of categories and specific interventions, but I found a lot of commonality between the different interventions and couldn't ever be specific enough to meet all situations anyways. Instead I have decided on a universal individual intervention guide. After that I'd like to develop an intervention guide which includes more than one person and one for the whole class or a larger group.

Making a web app would probably be a good way to go one step at a time and have some branching.
