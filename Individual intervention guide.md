# **Individual Classroom Intervention Guide**

This guide will help you talk with students about their actions and find ways to make things better. Follow the steps, and if you need to make a choice, the guide will tell you which section to go to next.

## **1\. Before the Discussion (Quick Prep)**

Before you talk with the student, take a moment to get ready.

* Take a deep, calm breath.  
* Remember something positive about the student.  
* Find a quiet, private spot to talk, away from other students.

### **Inviting the Student**

When you are ready, invite the student to join you in the quiet spot. Be clear and calm in your invitation.

**Suggested Phrasings:**

* "Hi \[Student's Name\], when you finish that sentence/activity, I'd like to talk with you for a few minutes in \[mention the quiet spot, e.g., 'the calm corner' or 'just outside the door'\]. We can talk about what happened and how to make things better."  
* "Hello \[Student's Name\], I noticed something just now, and I'd like to understand it better. Can you come with me to \[mention the quiet spot\] for a quick chat when you're ready?"

When you are ready, go to [Section 2](#2.-checking-in:-how-are-you-feeling?).

## **2\. Checking In: How Are You Feeling?** {#2.-checking-in:-how-are-you-feeling?}

Start by gently checking in with the student about their current feelings. This helps establish a personal connection and provides emotional context for the conversation.

**Sentence Frames:**

* "How are you feeling right now?"  
* "Is there anything you want to share about how you're feeling?"  
* "I can see you might be feeling \[sad/angry/frustrated\]. Is that right?"

**Examples:**

* "How are you feeling right now, \[student's name\]?"  
* "Before we talk about what happened, is there anything you want to share about how you're feeling?"  
* *(If they seem upset)* "I can see you might be feeling a little sad. Is that how you feel?"

Listen carefully to their answer.

Does the student share their feelings or seem willing to engage?

* Yes, they share: Go to Section 3\.  
* No, they are quiet or unwilling to respond: Go to Section 10\.

## **3\. Starting the Conversation: Observe and State Facts**

Now it's time to talk. Start by sharing what you saw or heard. Keep it simple and about the facts, not about why they did it.  
Sentence Frame: "I noticed ..."  

**Examples:**

* "I noticed the loud noise during quiet reading time."  
* "I noticed you and \[student's name\] were arguing about the blocks."  
* "I noticed you were not working on your drawing."  
* "I noticed you looked very sad and angry."

Now, listen to the student. Do they respond and seem ready to talk?

* Yes, they respond: Go to Section 4\.  
* No, they are quiet or unwilling to respond: Go to Section 10\.

## **4\. Exploring Impact: How Did It Affect Us?**

Help the student think about how their actions affected others or the situation.  
Sentence Frame:  
"How do you think that affected ...?"  

**Examples:**

* "How do you think that affected the other students or our classroom?"  
* "How do you think that affected \[other student's name\] or the play time?"  
* "How do you think that affected your learning?"  
* "How do you think your feelings affected others?"

Listen carefully to their answer.  
Does the student seem to understand how their actions affected others?

* Yes, they understand: Go to Section 5\.  
* No, they don't understand or don't agree: Go to Section 11\.

## **5\. Understanding Perspective: What Was Happening For You?**

Now, give the student a chance to share their side of the story. Listen with an open mind.  
**Sentence Frames:**

* "What was going on for you at that moment?"  
* "Can you help me understand what was happening there?"

Listen carefully to their answer.  
Does the student share their perspective?

* Yes, they share: Go to Section 6\.  
* No, they are quiet or unwilling to share: Go to Section 10\.

## **6\. Connecting to Needs: What Do We All Need?**

Help the student think about what everyone needs to feel safe, respected, and able to learn or play. This includes their own needs.  
**Sentence Frames:**

* "In our classroom, we all need to feel ..."  
* "What do you think others needed at that moment?"  
* "What do you think you needed at that moment?"

**Examples for "In our classroom, we all need to feel...":**

* "...safe and be able to learn."  
* "...safe, respected, and included."  
* "...happy and focused."

Does the student seem to understand the connection to needs and shared values?

* Yes, they see the connection: Go to Section 7\.  
* No, they struggle with this connection: Go to Section 11\.

## **7\. Finding Solutions: How Can We Make It Better?**

Work together to find ways to make things better for next time. This is about finding a plan together, not just telling them what to do.  
**Sentence Frames:**

* "What could we do differently next time so ...?"  
* "What ideas do you have for how you can meet your need without ...?"

**Examples:**

* "...so everyone can learn?"  
* "...so everyone feels good and can play together?"  
* "...without disrupting others?"  
* "...without hurting anyone's feelings?"

Does the student have ideas for solutions?

* Yes, they have ideas: Go to Section 8\.  
* No, they struggle to brainstorm ideas: Go to Section 12\.

## **8\. Making a Plan: Our Plan Together**

Agree on a clear plan for what the student will do next time. Make sure it's something they can really do.  
**Sentence Frames:**

* "So, our plan is ..."  
* "How will you know if our plan is working?"  
* "What will you do if you need help with the plan?"

**Examples:**

* "So, our plan is that next time you feel frustrated during quiet reading, you will raise your hand and ask to take a short break."  
* "So, our plan is that when you want to play with the blocks, you will ask \[student's name\] if they are ready to share."

Does the student agree to the plan?

* Yes, they agree: Go to Section 9\.  
* No, they don't agree or seem unsure: Go to Section 12\.

## **9\. Ending the Conversation: Looking Forward**

Finish the conversation on a positive and hopeful note. Reaffirm your belief in them.  
**Sentence Frames:**

* "Thank you for talking with me and making a plan. I’m really looking forward to seeing you succeed with this new plan. I know you can do it\!"  
* "I appreciate you thinking about how to make things better for everyone."  
* "I believe in you, and I'm here to help."  
* “How about I follow up with you \[time\] to see how it’s going?”

The conversation is complete.

## **10\. When a Student is Quiet or Unwilling to Respond**

If the student is not ready to talk, give them space and try again later. This is about building trust, not forcing a conversation.  
**Sentence Frames:**

* "It looks like you're not ready to talk right now, and that's okay."  
* "I'm here when you are ready to talk about what happened."  
* "We can try again in a little while."

**Examples:**

* "It looks like you're not ready to talk right now, and that's okay. I'm here when you are ready."  
* "I understand you might not want to talk right now. We can try again after recess."

**After giving them space, try to re-engage later:** Go back to Section 2\. If they continue to be unwilling to talk after a second attempt, consider involving a school counselor or another trusted adult.

## **11\. When a Student Struggles with Understanding Impact or Needs**

If the student is having trouble seeing how their actions affect others or connecting to needs, provide more support and concrete examples.  
**Sentence Frames:**

* "When you \[describe action\], what happened next?"  
* "How do you think \[other student/classroom\] felt when that happened?"  
* "Remember how we talked about everyone needing to feel safe? How did \[action\] make others feel about being safe?"  
* "Let's think about what *you* needed in that moment. Was it to feel heard? To have space?"

**Examples:**

* "When you made the loud noise, what happened next? Did others stop reading?"  
* "How do you think \[other student's name\] felt when you took their blocks without asking? Were they happy or sad?"  
* "Remember how we talked about everyone needing to feel respected? When you interrupted, how did that make others feel about being respected?"  
* "Maybe you needed to move your body. How could you do that without making noise during quiet reading?"

**After providing more support:** Go back to the section where they struggled (Section 3 or Section 5\) and try again. If they still struggle, consider using visual aids or role-playing, or seeking guidance from a colleague or school counselor.

## **12\. When a Student Struggles to Brainstorm Solutions or Agree to a Plan**

If the student is having difficulty coming up with ideas or committing to a plan, offer gentle suggestions and support.  
**Sentence Frames:**

* "What if we tried ...?"  
* "Would it help if ...?"  
* "How about we try this plan for today, and then we can talk about it again tomorrow?"  
* "What part of this plan feels tricky for you?"

**Examples:**

* "What if we tried taking three deep breaths when you feel angry, before you talk?"  
* "Would it help if we had a special quiet spot you could go to when you need a break?"  
* "How about we try this plan for today, and if it's too hard, we can talk about a different idea tomorrow?"  
* "What part of this plan feels tricky for you? Is it remembering to ask before taking the blocks?"

**After offering suggestions:** Go back to Section 8 and try to finalize a plan. If they still struggle, it might be helpful to involve a parent or guardian, or a school counselor, to brainstorm solutions together.
